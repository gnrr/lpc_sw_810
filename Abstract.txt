Purpose:
Pattern Match example program

Running mode:
* Compile, Flash the program and reset.
* Default project target set to GPIO_Release (exectuing from flash)
* Can the run project from RAM by setting project target to GPIO_Debug

Note:
Tested on LPC800 LPCXpresso Board
LPC800 running at 24 MHz

Output:
Following 8 GPIO pins are used for the pattern match engine
PIO_0, PIO0_1, PIO0_16, PIO0_17, PIO0_8, PIO0_9, PIO0_14, and PIO0_15

GPIO_INT_BMAT - Output of the pattern match engine on PIO0_13 is asserted
when one of the slices is true.
